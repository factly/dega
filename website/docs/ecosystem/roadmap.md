# Roadmap

Dega is currently an [incubating](/docs/ecosystem/projects#maturity-levels) project at Factly Labs. It is currently deployed in Production at Factly and we are actively working on bug fixes and adding new features. You can track the progress of the project on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/factly/dega).

We are currently also working on Dega Cloud which is a [Managed Hosting](/docs/introduction/managed-hosting) and is the easiest way to get started with Dega. Dega Cloud is available as invite-only. Please write to **dega@factly.in** if you want to enroll as one of the early adopters for Dega Cloud and some one from the team will get back to you at the earliest.

An [Open Roadmap](https://github.com/factly/dega/projects) will be maintained on the GitHub repository once all the major features are implemented and the application evolves into a stable version.
